# Shopping-Screen

The program opens a login dialog which prompts the user for a password. The password entered by the user is then compared to an encrypted password.
Upon entering the correct password, a shopping screen pops up. The user can then enter their info, and the "order" is written to a .txt file.

### If you are on MacOS

1. Java comes installed with OSX. So, click on the green button in the top right that says ```Code```, click ```Download ZIP```, and then execute the following commands in your terminal:

```
cd ~/Downloads/Shopping-Screen-main
javac *.java
java Driver
```
The following codeblock above first puts you in the directory containing the shopping screen, then compiles all java files, and then executes the program.

### If you are on Windows

1. **Note: java installation on Windows is cumbersome.** Check if you have java installed by writing ```java -version``` in the command prompt. If you don't have java installed, click [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk19-windows) and install the latest JDK version. Click ```x64 Installer``` as your installation option.

2. Go to your downloads folder and open the file you just installed; go through the entire installation process (you don't need to change any options).

3. Open up the start menu and type in *environment variables*. Select *edit the system environment variables*.

4. In the *System Properties Window*, under the *Advanced* tab, click *Environment Variables...*

5. Under the *System variables* category, select the *Path* variable and click *Edit*

6. Click the New button and enter the path to the Java bin directory (will be ```C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-<version number>\bin```. For example, if you installed JDK 19.0.1, it would be ```C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-19.0.1\bin```. Click ok to save the changes.

7. In the _Environment Variables_ window, under the _System variables_ category, click the **Newâ€¦** button to create a new variable.

8. Name the variable as **_JAVA_HOME_**, and in the variable value field, paste the path to your Java jdk directory and click **OK**.

9. Confirm the changes by clicking **OK** in the _Environment Variables_ and _System properties_windows_.

10. Test the installation by opening up your command prompt and writing ```java -version```. If the installation was successful, you should see something similar to the following:

11. Open up your command prompt (if it isn't already), and execute the following commands:
```
cd ~/Downloads/Shopping-Screen-main
javac *.java
java Driver
```
The following codeblock above first puts you in the directory containing the shopping screen, then compiles all java files, and then executes the program.

## How to Use?
1. Download and compile all files, and then execute java Driver.java.
2. This will bring up a login screen. To see how the GUI responds to incorrect attempts, enter in any word other than "password".
   If you'd like to progress to the shopping screen, enter "password".
3. At the shopping screen, enter in a name and address, and then press save to write the order to a .txt file, or clear if you want
   to write another order.
