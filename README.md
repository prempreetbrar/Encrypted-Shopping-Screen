# Shopping-Screen

The program opens a login dialog which prompts the user for a password. The password entered by the user is then compared to an encrypted password.
Upon entering the correct password, a shopping screen pops up. The user can then enter their info, and the "order" is written to a .txt file.

2. Run 
```
sudo apt install default-jre
sudo apt install default-jdk

``` 
in the terminal; type in Y when prompted.

### If you are on MacOS

1. Java comes installed with OSX. So, click on the green button in the top right that says ```Code```, click ```Download ZIP```, and then execute the following commands in your terminal:

```
cd ~/Downloads/Shopping-Screen-main
javac *.java
