# Shopping-Screen

The program opens a login dialog which prompts the user for a password. The password entered by the user is then compared to an encrypted password.
Upon entering the correct password, a shopping screen pops up. The user can then enter their info, and the "order" is written to a .txt file.

## Demo of the Program:

### If you are on MacOS

1. Java comes installed with OSX. So, click on the green button in the top right that says ```Code```, click ```Download ZIP```, and then execute the following commands in your terminal:

```
cd ~/Downloads/Shopping-Screen-main
javac *.java
java Driver
```
The following codeblock above first puts you in the directory containing the shopping screen, then compiles all java files, and then executes the program.

&nbsp;

### If you are on Windows

1. **Note: java installation on Windows is cumbersome.** Check if you have java installed by writing ```java -version``` in the command prompt.

If you don't have java installed, click [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk19-windows) and install the latest JDK version. Click ```x64 Installer``` as your installation option.

## [order.txt]:
- The name sits by itself on the first line of the file, and each line of the address sits on a separate line following the name.

_An example order that I placed:_

## How to Use?
1. Download and compile all files, and then execute java Driver.java.
2. This will bring up a login screen. To see how the GUI responds to incorrect attempts, enter in any word other than "password".
   If you'd like to progress to the shopping screen, enter "password".
3. At the shopping screen, enter in a name and address, and then press save to write the order to a .txt file, or clear if you want
   to write another order.
